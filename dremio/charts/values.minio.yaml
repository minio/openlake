# The Dremio image used in the cluster.
#
# It is *highly* recommended to update the version tag to
# the version that you are using. This will ensure that all
# the pods are using the same version of the software. If
# you are directly consuming Dremio's images from Docker Hub,
# when specifying which version to use, it is best to use the
# full version tag in the form X.Y.Z (i.e. 21.1.0), as image
# tags in the form X.Y (i.e. 21.1) are updated with the latest
# patch version released.
#
# Using the image tag latest or in the form X.Y
# will potentially cause Dremio to upgrade versions
# automatically during redeployments and may negatively impact
# the cluster.

# podAnnotations: Pod annotations are applied to the pods that are deployed.
# labels: Labels operate much like annotations.
# podLabels: Labels that are applied to the pods that are deployed.
# nodeSelector: Target pods to nodes based on labels set on the nodes. For more
#   information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#nodeselector
# tolerations: Tolerations allow the negation of taints that have been applied to some set of nodes
#   in the Kubernetes cluster so that pods can be scheduled on those tainted nodes.
